    "---\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Out of the box, Webpack is only able to bundle Javascript and JSON files. If we want to include other type of files like CSS, SASS, png, HTML etc, we have to use loaders.\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Essentially, most of those files will be transformed into Javascript, like images will be transformed into data URL so that it is workable by Webpack. All these job is done by loaders \n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Setting up Loader\n",
    "---\n",
    "To set up loader, we first need to install them. As you may have guessed it, it is also NPM modules. Some examples of the available loaders are:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `style-loader` - Injects CSS into the DOM via `<style>` tag\n",
    "* `css-loader` - Transform CSS into Javascript, which then can be processed by `style-loader`\n",
    "* `sass-loader` - Transform SCSS into CSS, which then can be processed by `css-loader`\n",
    "* `ts-loader` - Transform Typescript into JS\n",
    "\n",
    "Simply run `npm install -D [loaderType]` to install those loaders \n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Configuration\n",
    "---\n",
    "That alone is not enough, we need to tell Webpack that upon encountering the specified file types like CSS, it has to use loaders before being processed. This is done in the `webpack.config.js` file.\n",
    "\n",
    "Inside, declare the `module` property, which will be a Javascript Object. Inside it, define another property `rules`, meaning we are setting up rules for compilation process. For basics, `rules` is an array containing Javascript objects which have the keys:\n",
    "   \n",
    "* `test` - Upon encountering a file, a test will be ran on the filename to determine if a loader has to be used. It is usually a Javascript regex object, like `/\\.css$/`, matching any file that ends in `.css`\n",
    "* `use` - An array of strings, specifying the type of loaders we want to use on this particular filetype\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "The configuration shall look as follows:\n",
    "```javascript\n",
    "module: {\n",
    "    rules: [\n",
    "        {\n",
    "            test: /\\.scss$/,\n",
    "            use: ['style-loader', 'css-loader', 'sass-loader']\n",
    "        }, \n",
    "        {\n",
    "            test: /\\.ts$/,\n",
    "            use: ['ts-loader']\n",
    "        }\n",
    "    ]\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "__Important: Notice how the loaders are arranged for parsing `scss` files. The loaders will work from behind, starting with `sass-loader` until the front, `style-loader`. The ordering is important. Remember that!__\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Importing Dem Files\n",
    "---\n",
    "Now we possess the ability to include css, ts, scss files in bundling our application! How?\n",
    "\n",
    "It's actually very simple! Inside the javascript code, simply __import__ it!\n",
    "\n",
    "```javascript\n",
    "import './styles/mystyle.scss`;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Upon compilation, Webpack will detect this import, test it, and apply appropriate loaders according to what you've set up! Cheers!\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Inline Loaders\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "We can also tell Webpack to use specific loaders inline, inside the import statement. For each loader we want to use, seperate them with a `!` delimiter. Again, ordering is from back to front. Example as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "```javascript\n",
    "import Styles from '!style-loader!css-loader?modules!./styles.css';\n",
