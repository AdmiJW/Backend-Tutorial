<!--
    _ViewImports.cshtml is useful for 'using' statements across every cshtml that we want to use.

    For example, the default automatically imported tag helpers for us, so that we can use tag helpers
    whenever we want, like asp-controller, asp-action and asp-for

    _ViewImports.cshtml affects both layout and non-layout pages, that's why we can use tag helpers too in
    the _Layout.cshtml!
